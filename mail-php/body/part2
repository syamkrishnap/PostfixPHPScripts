same mail, using exactly the same method, to one of your own mailboxes, 
and use a tool to inspect the complete mail source. </p>

<p>The reason I say this is because GMail usually inserts plus-signs when there&#39;s a space in the URL. </p>

<p>You have to be absolutely sure it&#39;s not your end inserting them. Just
 looking at what you intent to send is not enough in this case.</p>

<p>I can only guess why spaces would appear in your output. It all 
depends on how you send emails. Usually it is caused by a conversion or 
encoding/decoding.</p></div><br>-- <br><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature">Syamkrishna.P<br></div></div>
