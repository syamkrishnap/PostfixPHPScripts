A “distributed ledger” is another term for a blockchain. It distributes a
database (a ledger) of transactions to all participants in a network (also
called “peers” or “nodes”). There is no central administrator or
centralised data storage. In essence, it is:

Distributed: The blockchain database is shared among potentially untrusted
participants and is demonstrably identical on all nodes in the network. All
participants have the same information.
Immutable: The blockchain database is an unalterable history of all
transactions that uses block hashes to make it easy to detect and prevent
attempts to alter the history.
Secure: All changes are performed by transactions that are signed by known
identities.
These features work together, along with agreed-upon consensus mechanisms,
to provide “adversarial trust” among all participants in a blockchain
network.
