In other words that what GMail actually receives? Simply send the same
mail, using exactly the same method, to one of your own mailboxes, and use
a tool to inspect the complete mail source.

The reason I say this is because GMail usually inserts plus-signs when
there's a space in the URL.

You have to be absolutely sure it's not your end inserting them. Just
looking at what you intent to send is not enough in this case.

I can only guess why spaces would appear in your output. It all depends on
how you send emails. Usually it is caused by a conversion or
encoding/decoding.
