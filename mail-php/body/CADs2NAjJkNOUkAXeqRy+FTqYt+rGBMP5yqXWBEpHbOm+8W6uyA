Many people use web-based email clients, like Yahoo Mail and Gmail. Those
who require a lot more space - especially businesses - often have to invest
in their own servers. That means that they also have to have a way of
receiving and transmitting emails, which means that they need to set up
their own mail servers. To that end, programs like Postfix and Microsoft
Exchange are two of the most popular options. Such programs facilitate the
preceding process behind the scenes. Those who send and receive messages
across those mail servers, of course, generally only see the "send" and
"receive" parts of the process.

At the end of the day, a mail server is a computer that helps move files
along to their intended destinations. In this case, of course, those files
are email messages. As easy as they are to take for granted, it's smart to
have a basic grasp of how mail servers work.
