Mail servers can be broken down into two main categories: outgoing mail
servers and incoming mail servers. Outgoing mail servers are known as SMTP,
or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, servers. Incoming mail servers come in
two main varieties. POP3, or Post Office Protocol, version 3, servers are
best known for storing sent and received messages on PCs' local hard
drives. IMAP, or Internet Message Access Protocol, servers always store
copies of messages on servers. Most POP3 servers can store messages on
servers, too, which is a lot more convenient.
