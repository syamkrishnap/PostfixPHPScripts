This is something related to CACHING concept. suppose, you have recently
deployed your php code on your server but you forgot to upload images. you
tested once with your email logic. your system generated an HTML email.
When this email will hit the gmail server GoogleImageProxy will try to
fetch and store the images from your site to its own proxy server. while
fetching the images, GoogleImageProxy found some 404 statuses against your
missing images and 403 against some protected images. GoogleImagesProxy has
stored these statuses into its own proxy server.
